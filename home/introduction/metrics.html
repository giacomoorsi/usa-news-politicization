<p>We, as human beings, need some help to put facts into perspective. Most of the time, our instincts make this task impossible, and the humans that update our worldview don't help, or do they?</p>
<p>We need some <b>metrics</b> to quantify whether the news sources that feed us information are impartial. To do this we define a couple of handy statistics.</p>
