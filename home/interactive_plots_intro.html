        All the graphs in this page are <b>interactive</b>. This means that points on the plot can be moused over to
        display precise information and sometimes, even additional information not shown
        otherwise (like the number of articles from a source in a particular year). You
        can also explore the plots and filter what is shown by clicking on the labels on
        the right-hand side of the plot.
